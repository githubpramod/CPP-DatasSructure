/*
 *Composition is a stronger form of aggregation. It has all the characteristics of aggregation, plus
two more:
• The part may belong to only one whole.
• The lifetime of the part is the same as the lifetime of the whole.
A car is composed of doors (among other things). The doors can’t belong to some other car,
and they are born and die along with the car. A room is composed of a floor, ceiling, and
walls. While aggregation is a “has a” relationship, composition is a “consists of” relationship.
