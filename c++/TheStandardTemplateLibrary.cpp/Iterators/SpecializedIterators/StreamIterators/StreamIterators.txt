Stream iterators allow you to treat files and I/O devices (such as cin and cout ) as if they were
iterators. This makes it easy to use files and I/O devices as arguments to algorithms.
The major purpose of the input and output iterator categories is to support these stream iterator
classes. Input and output iterators make it possible for appropriate algorithms to be used
directly on input and output streams.
Stream iterators are actually objects of classes that are templetized for different types of input
or output. There are two stream iterators: ostream_iterator and istream_iterator .
